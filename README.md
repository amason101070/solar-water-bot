# Solar Water Bot Raspberry Pi Automatic Plant Watering System
Solar Water Bot is a solar powered plant watering system built with a Raspberry Pi, sensors, motor, pump and Python code. This was created for my sons 6th grade science project.

## Open Top Of Tub When It Rains
This is Python code that will trigger the motor to turn on when the rain sensor detects rain. The motor will open the top of the tub so rain can be captured in the tub. The code also detects when the rain sensor is dry and will trigger the motor to spin the opposite way to close the top of the tub. This assures the water does not get polluted with outside elements when it is not raining.

## Turn On Water Pump When Soil Is Dry
This is Python code that will trigger the water pump to turn on when the soil sensor is dry. The pump will turn on pulling water from the tub through water lines up to the plants. The code also detects when the soil sensor is wet and will trigger the pump to turn off. This assures the plants are only watered when the plant soild is dry and not overwatered when the soil is wet.
